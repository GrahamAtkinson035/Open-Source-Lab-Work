We fixed a dead link to an article and submitted a bug report to FreeBSD. It is important to maintain good documentation because people rely on the information to write and maintain good code, and with the syntax constantly changing the documentation must also change to accomodate it. During this lab I learned that documentation and old links often become outdated and the developers cannot always fix bugs, which leaves the responsibility with the community.
